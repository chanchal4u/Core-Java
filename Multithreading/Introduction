Multitasking: Executing several tasks simultaneously is the concept of multitasking.

It is of two types:
	1. Process Based
	2. Thread Based

	1. Process Based Multitasking:
	Executing several tasks simultaneously where   each task is a separate independent program(process) is called process based multitasking.
	Ex: While typing a java program in the editor we can listen audio songs from the same system at the same time we can download a file from internet.
	All these tasks will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other.
	Hence it processed based multitasking.
	Process based multitasking is best suitable at OS level.

	2. Thread Based Multitasking:
	Executing several tasks simultaneously where   each task is a separate independent part of the same program is called Thread based multitasking and each independent part is called Thread, .
	Thread based multitasking is best suitable at Programmatic level.
	
	NOTE: Whether it is process based or thread based , the main objective of multi tasking is to reduce response  time of the system and to improve performance.
	
	The main important application areas of multithreading are:
	1. To develop multi-media graphics
	2. To  develop animations 
	3. To develop video games
	4. To develop web/Application servers etc.
	5. When compared with old languages , developing multithreaded applications in java is very easy because java provides inbuilt support for multithreading with rich API(Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup ..)
